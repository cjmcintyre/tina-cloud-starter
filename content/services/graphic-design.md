Graphic design is a key driver in a digital business strategy. The creation of compelling content is only half of the battle, and a compelling visual can make or break the success of your online brand. The best approach to the creation of a digital design is to use an “information design” approach where content is the starting point and style is the finishing touch.

When I say “information design”, what I mean is creating an environment in which you’re telling the brand story, not just putting pretty pictures up on the website. The content you provide should drive the user experience and be accessible enough that anyone can find their way around. This should be considered before even the visual aspects of the website are created.

### We all know that having a good-looking website is essential for businesses in today's competitive market. 

However, creating a beautiful design can be really hard and time consuming. You have to deal with lots of different people from the client, designer and developer side. And most importantly you need to understand how your customers think so you can create a design they will love. Unfortunately this leads to frustration on both sides - clients who don't get what they want and designers who are not happy with their work being changed by the client over and over again until it gets approved. In fact only 30% of designs actually get approved!
